# Privacy Policy for Syngo

_Last updated: November 20, 2025_

Thank you for using **Syngo** ("we", "us", or "our").  
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Syngo mobile application (the "App").

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.


## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the minimum information needed to provide the core features of Syngo.

### 1.1. Account and Device Information

- **Anonymous identifiers**  
  We use Firebase Authentication with anonymous sign‑in to create a unique ID for your device. We do not require your name, email address, or phone number to use the App.
- **Device information**  
  Basic device information (such as device model, operating system version, and app version) may be collected for diagnostics, analytics, and to improve performance.

### 1.2. Pairing and App Content

- **Pairing data**  
  When you pair your device with another person, we store pairing codes and pair records so that your data can be shared securely between the two of you.
- **App content**  
  We store content you create in the App, such as:
  - Todos and reminders
  - Favorites, notes and links
  - Stickers and related metadata
  - Notifications and activity history

This data is stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage, and is only accessible to you and your paired partner according to our security rules.

### 1.3. Images and Media

If you upload images (for example, stickers or avatars), those files are stored using Firebase Storage and/or Cloudinary. Image URLs and metadata are stored in Firestore to display them inside the App.

### 1.4. Notifications and Device Tokens

If you enable push notifications, we collect:

- A **device push token** (e.g. from Apple Push Notification service and Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Your notification preferences (which types of notifications you want to receive)

We use these tokens only to send you notifications related to the App’s features (such as reminders and pair activity). We do not sell or share these tokens with advertisers.

### 1.5. Usage and Diagnostics Data

We may collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports (for example, via Firebase, Sentry, or similar tools) to:

- Monitor app reliability
- Understand feature usage at an aggregate level
- Fix bugs and improve performance

This data does not include the content of your todos, notes, or stickers.

### 1.6. Objectionable Content
We have a zero-tolerance policy for objectionable content. While your content is private between you and your partner, we reserve the right to investigate reports of abuse. If content is found to violate our End User License Agreement (EULA)—such as being harassment, pornography, or illegal—we will remove it and may suspend the offending account.


## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and operate the App and its features
- Sync your data across devices within a pair
- Send you reminders and notifications that you have opted in to receive
- Maintain and improve the App’s performance, reliability, and security
- Detect, prevent, and address technical issues or abuse

We do **not** sell your data or use it for third‑party advertising.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share your personal information with third parties except in the following cases:

- **Service providers**  
  We use trusted third‑party services such as:
  - Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging)
  - Cloudinary (image hosting)
  These providers process data on our behalf to deliver core functionality such as storage, synchronization, and notifications.

- **Legal requirements**  
  We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal requests (e.g. subpoena, court order).

We do not sell your data to data brokers or advertising networks.

## 4. Data Security

We use industry‑standard security practices and the built‑in security features of our service providers (such as Firebase Security Rules and HTTPS) to protect your data in transit and at rest.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your data as long as your account and pairing are active, or as needed to provide the App’s services.

You may request deletion of your data by contacting us (see the "Contact Us" section below). Upon a valid deletion request, we will:

- Remove or anonymize your data from our systems, subject to technical and legal limitations.

If you uninstall the App without requesting deletion, your data may remain in our systems so that it can be restored if you reinstall and pair again.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Syngo is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 7. International Transfers

Our service providers (such as Firebase) may store and process data on servers located in different countries. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your information to these locations, which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.

## 8. Your Choices

You have the following options:

- **Notifications**  
  You can enable or disable push notifications in your device settings and in the App’s settings.
- **Images and media**  
  You can choose whether to grant the App access to your camera and photo library. If you deny access, some features (like stickers or avatars) may not be available.
- **Account and data**  
  You may request deletion of your data by contacting us.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
